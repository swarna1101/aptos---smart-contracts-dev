# `01-initial`

So this initial contract allows you to do one thing - introduce yourself.

1. It introduces a `Passport` struct which holds nothing but your name.
2. If you decide to call `say_my_name` from an account - it will store your name inside `Passport` structure in your own account's storage.
3. You can change your name at any time.
4. It doesn't showcase many of the Move's capabilities. It's just basics so I can deploy anything.

## Setting up

1. Run `aptos init` in project directory
- it will ask you for private key, endpoints etc
- it will create `.aptos` directory containing this information
2. If you are using my code you may want to update addresses in `Move.toml`

## Reading

You can read the annotated sources in the following order:

- [Move.toml](./Move.toml)
- [Useless.move](./sources/Useless.move)

## Publishing

Publishing module is as simple as:

```
aptos move publish
```

## Interacting with contract

Sadly this one doesn't read named addresses from `Move.toml` at the moment so you need to provide full address by hand:

```
aptos move run --function-id 4348f2118192eb9db970a108acf6713bcd5e527e0687a53454abc74864b20d83::Useless::say_your_name --args string:john
```

## Reading resources via REST API

Now we can confirm if the resource was created properly:

```
httpx https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/4348f2118192eb9db970a108acf6713bcd5e527e0687a53454abc74864b20d83/resources
```

1. You can use `curl` instead of `httpx` if you don't have it.
2. I'm using the same account for contract deployment and interaction, but it's completely valid to call `say_my_name` with different account - it should create resources in it as well.
